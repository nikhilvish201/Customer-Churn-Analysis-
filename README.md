Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive Customer Churn Analysis using a medium-sized telecom dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior and preferences. The primary goal was to guide strategic business decisions by identifying high-risk customer segments and the main drivers of churn.
Technology & Methodology
The project utilized a robust process combining database management, data transformation, and business intelligence visualization.


Database Management: SQL Server was used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and complex transformations.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handled missing values (nulls) by imputing 'None' or 'No' for categorical columns like Internet_Type, Value_Deal, and Multiple_Lines to ensure data integrity before analysis.
Analysis and Visualization: Power BI was the tool utilized to create the interactive Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard and uncover key business insights.

Dataset Scope: The analysis was performed on a medium-sized customer dataset comprising 6,418 rows and 32 columns.

Key Data Factors: Focused on strong numeric signals like Tenure, Monthly Charges, and Long-Distance Charges, which indicate high churn predictability.

Key Findings & Business Insights:
The analysis of the 6,418 customer records identified a total churn of 1,732 customers, resulting in a $27.0\%$ churn rate7.

1)High-Risk Customer Segments 
Contract Type is Critical: The highest churn rate is observed in Month-to-Month contracts at 46.5%. This is drastically higher than One-Year 11.0% and Two-Year 2.7% contracts.

Payment Method: The two highest-churning payment methods are Mailed Check 37.8% and Bank Withdrawal 34.4%.

Tenure & Age: Customers with shorter tenure (6-12 months and 18-24 months) show high churn rates around 28%.

The >50 age group also shows the highest churn rate (approaching 30% among age segments.

Gender: Males have a significantly higher total churn contribution at 64.15% ,1.11K compared to females 0.62K, 35.85%.

2)Service and State Performance
Top Churning Service: Fiber Optic internet is the top churning service type, accounting for 332 churns.

Geographic Hotspots: The top two states, Uttar Pradesh (157) and Tamil Nadu (153), are major contributors to total churn.

3. Reason for Churn (Third Image, Bottom Right)
Competitor Threat: The leading stated reason for churn is Competitor (761), which is more than double the next highest reason (Dissatisfaction at 300).

Strategic Recommendations:
1)Reduce Month-to-Month Contract Churn
2)Optimize Payment Processes
3)Mitigate Churn in High-Risk Segments.
4)Respond to Competitor Threat
5)Improve Fiber Optic Service Quality
